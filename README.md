# BasicComputer
A text-only basic computer with VGA-output using a ESP32/ESP8266 and a FPGA

## What it does
It is a simply computer with a BASIC-interpreter that is close to the one of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. The computer is text-based only, but does support 8 colors for both foreground and background.

The computer has a 80x60 character display with a 640x480 resolution. You can use a PS2-keyboard connected to the FPGA-board or a HTML-based keyboard using a browser as input.

There are BASIC-commands for http-based communication (both incoming and outgoing), reading and writing of programs to SPIFFS, reading and writing of data to SPIFFS.

## How to make it
### ESP
### FPGA
### 3d-print
### Connect ESP and FPGA
### Place ESP and FPGA in 3d-print
