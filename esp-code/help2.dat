SAVE        SAVE "test" saves the current program under the name "test" 
LOAD        LOAD "test" clears all variables and the current program and
            loads the program "test"
DIR         DIR lists all programs
DELETE      DELETE "test" removes the program "test"
HTTPGET$    HTTPGET$("http://www.google.com/") returns the HTML-source of
            http://www.google.com/" as a string.
            Be carefull to not overflow the memory. This will result in 
            a crash and reboot of the host.
FREEMEM     Returns the number of free bytes available for variables and
            program lines.
FREEHOST    Returns the number of free bytes available in the ESP-host
            On a ESP32 there will be a lot of available memory, but this
            is not contiguous and therefore not useable as basic memory.
            See SETMEMSIZE for the largest contiguous amount.
IPADDR$     Returns the IP-address of the ESP-host as a string
SETSSID     SETSSID("myssid") sets the ssid the ESP-host will use. Reboot needed        
SETSSIDPW   SETSSIDPW("mypassword") sets the password the ESP-host will use
            Reboot needed
GETSSID$    Returns the current SSID as a string     
MILLIS      Returns the number of milliseconds since the start of the ESP-host
OPEN        OPEN("testdata") opens a file for reading and writing
            Reading starts at 0, writing starts at the end of the file
            If the file does not exist it will be created
            ONLY ONE FILE CAN BE OPEN AT THE SAME TIME
CLOSE       CLOSE closes the current file
READLINE$   Returns a line from the current file as a string
READ$       READ(4) returns 4 characters from the current file as a string
READPOS     Returns the position of the read-cursor
WRITEPOS    Returns the position of the write-cursor
RSEEK       RSEEK(10) sets the read-cursor at position 10
WSEEK       WSEEK(10) sets the write-cursor at position 10
WRITE       Writes a string or number to the current file
ERASE       ERASE("testdata") erases "testdata"
DATADIR     Lists all data files
EOF         Returns true if the end of the open file is reached
HTTPRECV$   Returns the last value received on 
            http://IPADDR$/basicrecv?value=<something> as a string
HTTPRECV    Returns 1 when a new value is received
REBOOT      Reboots the ESP-host
INDEXOF     LET a$="test":PRINT INDEXOF("e",a$) returns 2
COUNTOF     LET a$="test":PRINT COUNTOF("t",a$) returns 2
FGCOLOR     FGCOLOR 0 sets the foreground color for the next print to 0
            FGCOLOR "blue" is also valid. Color names are case-insensitive
            0 = Black, 1 = Blue,   2 = Green,  3 = Cyan,
            4 = Red,   5 = Purple, 6 = Yellow, 7 = White
            Use of color names is also possible in BGCOLOR, SETFG and SETBG
BGCOLOR     BGCOLOR 0 sets the background color for the next print to 0
SETMEMSIZE  SETMEMSIZE 1000:REBOOT. Sets the amount of memory available for
            basic to 1000 bytes. If set higher than available in the host
            the system will detect this and revert to a safe value of
            8192 bytes. Maximum value for a ESP32 is 113792. Maximum value
            for a ESP8266 is 16384 bytes.
SETFG       SETFG 0 sets the foreground color to 0 and repaints the screen
SETBG       SETBG 1 sets the background color to 1 and repaints the screen
